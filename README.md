# Inhuman

A dark mode flutter app that takes an image from the gallery or camera (selectable) and hides the faces of human beings in it.
Uses Firebase ML kit for doing the same.
Uses PageView to display multiple images.

## Future updates may include:
1. Selective face hiding
2. Changing the colour of the hidden part
3. Alignment / Orientation and resizing issues of the picture

### Note:
google-services.json has been removed from android/app/ for security issues (API key exposure). This file needs to be there for the app to work, and hence should be put in when the project is built.
